Multi User  Blog
================

This is the Multi User Blog project for the Udacity's Full Stack Web
Developer Nanodegree.

The goal of this project was to building a multi user blog where users can
sign in and post blog posts as well as 'Like' and 'Comment' on other posts made
on the blog. This project is hosted on Google App Engine. This project
includes creating an authentication system for users to be able to register
and sign in and then create blog posts.

All of the project requirements are already included in the project, inside
the __lib__ folder.
